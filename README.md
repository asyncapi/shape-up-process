## Getting Started

This repo is used to store, discuss and vote pitches and bets on the next [ShapeUp cycles](https://shapeit.app/projects/org/asyncapi/27/cycles/c5f8ce8f?issue=I_kwDOBGu-185sGfbN)

## How To

1. Create a Pitch type issue
2. Once it's ready, meaning problem, solution shaped, rabbit holes and initial scope defined add `to discuss` label
3. During the cool down periods, we asynchronously pick all `to discuss` pitches, vote them and raise any concerns
4. When the Pitch owner got all the necessary feedback and votes he add `to plan`
5. The global product owner (fran) will pick from the `to plan` issues and select the relevant ones for the next cycle. 

## Lifecycle

- Draft pitch > to discuss > to plan > bet added to project
